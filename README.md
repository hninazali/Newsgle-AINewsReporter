# Newsgle - Am AI a reliable reporter?

Newsgle is “Google” for real time news updates. It intelligently searches most relevant articles from reliable Singapore news sources and provides a max 140 words succinct summary of news related to your search term. Heidi Lines is the AI news anchor of  Newsgle and it is able to read out the news summary for you, as well as pause and resume when you would like it to.

Newsgle was developed using ReactJs, Flask for frontend and backend respectively and is hosted on Heroku. Our deep learning model uses Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), an an autoregressive language model that produces human-like text, created by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence research laboratory.  The GPT-3 model is fed data selectively retrieved from NewsCatcher API that provides real-time coverage of news from over 60,000 news websites worldwide.
